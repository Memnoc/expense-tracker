![Screenshot_2024-08-07-08-48-26_](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11eedae1-82ff-4089-9658-4bc168b9f337)

A TUI expense tracker built with Rust and Ratatui.

## Dev Notes

I have initially tried surreal DB but due to the amount of errors with `chrono` I have then switched to `sqlx`

**commands**

```
cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features sqlite`
```
