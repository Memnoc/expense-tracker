![Screenshot_2024-08-29-06-58-44_](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caec4a48-ee97-46f9-8c46-f0d5daa6467a)

A TUI expense tracker built with Rust and Ratatui.

## Dev Notes

I have initially tried surreal DB but due to the amount of errors with `chrono` I have then switched to `sqlx`

**commands**

```
cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features sqlite`
```
